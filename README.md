# Minesweeper-SO2
A simple Minesweeper game implemented in **C** using the **Win32 API**.  
This project was created while studying for a college exam.

Some game functionality follows the exam requirements, while additional features, such as marking expected mine locations with flags, were added later to make the game more complete.  
Parts of the code are based on examples lectured during class.
